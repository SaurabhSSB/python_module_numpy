# To help us analyze and visualize your data effectively, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are essential Python libraries.
# Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:
# Numpy: A library for numerical operations, it provides support for arrays and matrices, making it efficient for mathematical computations.
# Pandas: Offers data structures like DataFrames and Series, ideal for data manipulation and analysis.
# Matplotlib: A plotting library that allows you to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
# Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
# These libraries work together seamlessly for tasks like data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and more. For your specific use case,
# we can leverage numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for plotting graphs, and seaborn for enhanced visualizations.
